### How does the software work?

In this simulation, investors can sell or buy stocks at different prices. The stock market will simulate NASDAQ or NYSE and show a simulated stock price trend. Then investors may make or lose money based on their decisions of buying and selling prices.

The stock price trends are randomized. Please be aware that the real-world stock price can be tricky and non-computable. Users or readers should never assume this model is working for real-world stock market transaction.

The project is to simulate stock transaction in the real world market. Users can buy or sell stocks on each day, and will gain or lose money based on their decisions. New features are added so that users can get the predicted next-day price. Users can use the predictions for better decision making. Visualization includes tables and figures. Users can have a straightforward sense of the real-time transaction.â€ƒ
